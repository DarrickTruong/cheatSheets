Note that for the manipulation jQuery functions, there are few distinctions to make. The functions .html() 
and .text() are different in a key way: .html() can be used to insert new HTML markup, meaning new HTML tags. 
.text() is used to get or set just the text value of an HTML element. For instance, you could use .text() to 
change the text of a paragraph, but if you want to put an ordered list inside of the paragraph, you need to 
use .html() to insert the appropriate tags into the paragraph.

Similarly, .append() and .html() do nearly the same thing; they both can alter the HTML content of the 
selected item. The function .append will add markup to the element in question, whereas .html() will overwrite 
the markup with whatever is run inside the parentheses. So keep in mind that if you want to add content, use 
.append(), but if you want to replace content, use .html().


Scope
<script>
  $(document).ready(function(){
   $('button').click(function(){
    $('div').append('<h3>I am a new content</h3>');
   });
   $(document).on('mouseover', 'h3', function(){
    $(this).css('color', 'pink');
   });
  });
 </script>
 <body>
  <button>Click me for new content!</button>
  <div class='a'>
   <h3>I am old content</h3>
  </div>
  <div class='b'>
   <h3>I am old content</h3>
  </div>
 </body>

</script>


Callback
<script>
    function attach_h3_handlers() {
        $('h3').click( function() { alert('You clicked an H3!'); });
    }
    $(document).ready( function() {
        attach_h3_handlers();
        $('button').click( function() {
            $('div').append('<h3>I am a dynamically generated H3</h3>'copy);
            attach_h3_handlers();
        });
    });
</script>
<body>
    <div>
        <button>Click me to add a new H3 tag!</button>
        <h3>Click me to see a message!</h3>
    </div>
</body>



.submit()
We can use the jQuery command .submit() to either submit an actual HTML form,
or we can use it as an event handler. What is meant by this is that .submit() has two purposes. 
Let's look at some sample code:
<script>
$('form').submit(function(){alert('you submitted me!');});

$('h4').click(function(){
     $('form').submit();
})

$('form').submit(function(){
    return false;
});

</script>

.serialize()
This function isn't one which you will actually see the effectiveness of until you really get into the 
heavy use of AJAX and APIs. But once you're there, you will be glad you learned it. The function .serialize() 
is a function that encodes a set of form elements into a computer-friendly array. Why is this helpful? 
Because .serialize() transforms data that the user inputs into a format that can be easily passed to a 
back-end process and used by a non-human entity. To illustrate what is really happening, watch the 
corresponding video and type along with it. Bear in mind that your user will never interact with any form 
element after it has been serialized - it is mostly used for cleaning up data before it is passed to either 
an AJAX request or an API. That being said, it is still an extremely useful piece of code. That's why we teach 
it!



traversing
<script>
    $('button').click(function(){
        $(this).siblings().children().children().text('Michael Choi was here!')
    })

</script>
